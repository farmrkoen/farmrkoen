## My conventions

**Naming convention for my repos:** starting with 4 letters
- Repos starting with "**meng**": everthing related to my masters degree (e.g. modules, templates)
- Repos starting with "**note**": should be just one. But I know myself. The place where I collect general notes about everything.
- Repos starting with "**proj**": for substantial projects (don't know what that means yet), like my website to learn the georgian language
- Repos starting with "**scri**": for short standalone scripts, like pdf-mergins or creating a website out of md files
- Repos starting with "**sand**": for learning projects, like matlab or python. Just to experiment with in a sandbox
