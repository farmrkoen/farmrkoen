- 👋 Hi, I’m @farmrkoen
- ⚙️ I'm a mechanicall engineer, currently working on industrial pumps
- 👀 I’m interested in everything technical, sustainability, nature conservation, animal protection, ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about embedded systems and the georgian language

## My conventions

- Repos starting with "**meng**": everthing related to my masters degree (e.g. modules, templates)
- Repos starting with "**learning**": things specifically designed to help with learning something (e.g learning-georgian: website designed to study georgian)
- Repos starting with "**notes**": should be just one. But I know myself. The place where I collect non-specific / general notes about everything. Vault in Obsidian, backup in Github
